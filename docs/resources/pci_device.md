# harvester_pci_device (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example: Attach PCI devices to a Virtual Machine

# First, create a virtual machine
resource "harvester_virtualmachine" "example" {
  name        = "example-vm-with-pci"
  namespace   = "default"
  description = "VM with PCI device passthrough"

  cpu    = 2
  memory = "4Gi"

  # IMPORTANT: The VM must be scheduled on a specific node where PCI devices are available
  # This is handled by the harvester_pci_device resource which sets node_name
  run_strategy = "RerunOnFailure"
  hostname     = "example-vm-pci"

  network_interface {
    name         = "nic-1"
    network_name = "vlan1"
  }

  disk {
    name        = "disk-1"
    type        = "disk"
    size        = "20Gi"
    bus         = "virtio"
    boot_order  = 1
    image       = "harvester-public/image-ubuntu20.04"
    auto_delete = true
  }
}

# Attach PCI devices to the VM
# Note: The PCI devices must be enabled for passthrough in Harvester UI first
resource "harvester_pci_device" "example" {
  name      = "example-pci-device-claim"
  namespace = "default"

  # The VM to attach PCI devices to
  vm_name = "${harvester_virtualmachine.example.namespace}/${harvester_virtualmachine.example.name}"

  # REQUIRED: The node where the VM must be deployed
  # This ensures the VM runs on the correct node where PCI devices are available
  # This prevents scheduling issues when multiple nodes have the same PCI device type
  node_name = "node-01"

  # List of PCI addresses to attach
  # Format: "0000:XX:YY.Z" (e.g., "0000:01:00.0")
  # The PCI devices must be enabled for passthrough in Harvester before they can be attached
  pci_addresses = [
    "0000:01:00.0", # Example: NVIDIA GPU
    "0000:01:00.1", # Example: Additional PCI device
  ]

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed-by  = "terraform"
  }
}

# Example: Multiple PCI devices from different nodes
# Note: Each harvester_pci_device resource can only attach devices from one node
# If you need devices from multiple nodes, you need multiple resources
resource "harvester_pci_device" "example_node2" {
  name      = "example-pci-device-claim-node2"
  namespace = "default"

  vm_name   = "${harvester_virtualmachine.example.namespace}/${harvester_virtualmachine.example.name}"
  node_name = "node-02"

  pci_addresses = [
    "0000:02:00.0",
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A unique name
- `node_name` (String) The name of the node where the VM must be deployed. This is mandatory to ensure the VM runs on the correct node where the PCI devices are available. This prevents scheduling issues when multiple nodes have the same PCI device type.
- `pci_addresses` (List of String) List of PCI addresses to attach to the VM. Each address should be in the format '0000:XX:YY.Z' (e.g., '0000:01:00.0'). The PCI devices must be enabled for passthrough in Harvester before they can be attached.
- `vm_name` (String) The name of the virtual machine to attach PCI devices to. Format: 'namespace/name' or 'name' (if in default namespace).

### Optional

- `description` (String) Any text you want that better describes this resource
- `labels` (Map of String)
- `namespace` (String)
- `tags` (Map of String)
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `message` (String)
- `state` (String)

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `default` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `read` (String)
- `update` (String)
